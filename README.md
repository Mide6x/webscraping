# Job Board Webscraping
## Introduction
This script, originally intended to just be a webscraping test project, might eventually be further developed into an api for getting "very recent" Python job opportunities. Fully built with python, this script scrapes a particular website for open job opportunities and returns a response in a clean JSON format.

## Output Format
   {
        "Job Title": "PythonDeveloper",
        "Company Name": "WingGlobalITServices",
        "Skills Required": "springboot,python,java,django,jpa,hibernate",
